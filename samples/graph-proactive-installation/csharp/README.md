## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app package (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Sideloading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

**Proactive Installation Sample App:** [Manifest](/samples/graph-proactive-installation/csharp/demo-manifest/graph-proactive-installation.zip)

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account
- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 6.0
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) or equivalent tunnelling solution

## Setup

1. Register a new application in the [Azure Active Directory â€“ App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.

  - Required Microsoft graph Application level permissions to run this sample app
     ![ApiPermission](ProactiveAppInstallation/Images/ApiPermission.png)
  - [Get consent for the Application permissions](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/auth-v2-service?context=graph%2Fapi%2F1.0&view=graph-rest-1.0#3-get-administrator-consent) by following steps mentioned here.

2. Setup for Bot
	- Register a AAD aap registration in Azure portal.
	- Also, register a bot with Azure Bot Service, following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration?view=azure-bot-service-3.0).
	- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
	- While registering the bot, use `https://<your_ngrok_url>/api/messages` as the messaging endpoint.

    > NOTE: When you create your app registration, you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

3. Setup NGROK
      - Run ngrok - point to port 3978

	```bash
	# ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
	```   
4. Setup for code

  - Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```
  - Modify the `/appsettings.json` and fill in the following details:
    - `{{YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID}}` - Generated from Step 1 while doing AAd app registration in Azure portal.
    - `{{ YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-PASSWORD}}` - Generated from Step 1, also referred to as Client secret
    - `{{ YOUR-APPCATALOG-TEAM-ID }}` - To get `TeamsappcatalogAppId` you first navigate to following link in your browser [Get TeamsAppCatalogId](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer?request=appCatalogs%2FteamsApps%3F%24filter%3DdistributionMethod%20eq%20'organization'&method=GET&version=v1.0&GraphUrl=https://graph.microsoft.com) from Microsoft Graph explorer. Then search with app name or based on Manifest App id  in Graph Explorer response and copy the `Id` [i.e teamApp.Id]
  
    ![MicGraph](ProactiveAppInstallation/Images/MicGraph.png)
    
  - Run the bot from Visual Studio:
  
    - Launch Visual Studio
    - File -> Open -> Project/Solution  
    - Navigate to `samples/graph-proactive-installation/csharp` folder
    - Select `ProactiveAppInstallation.sln` file
    - Press `F5` to run the project
    
4) Setup Manifest for Teams
- __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the ./TeamsAppManifest folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your app registration earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `{{Microsoft-App-Id}}` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)   
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `TeamsAppManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)

- Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload an app to your org's app catalog")
   - Go to Microsoft Teams. From the lower left corner, select Apps
   - From the lower left corner, choose Upload an app to your org's app catalog
   - Go to your project directory, the ./TeamsAppManifest folder, select the zip folder, and choose Open.
   - Select Add in the pop-up dialog box. Your app is uploaded to Teams.
