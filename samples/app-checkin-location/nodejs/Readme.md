# Get Checkin info of user

This sample shows feature where user can checkin with current location and view all previous checkins using bot.

`Currently, Microsoft Teams support for get geolocation capability is only available for mobile clients`

## Included Features
* Bots
* Adaptive Cards
* Task Modules
* Device Permission API (Location)

## Interaction with app

## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app package (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Sideloading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

**App check-in location:** [Manifest](/samples/app-checkin-location/csharp/demo-manifest/App-checkin-location.zip)

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
- To test locally, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed on your development machine (version 16.14.2  or higher)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or equivalent tunneling solution
- [M365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to a Teams account with the 
   appropriate permissions to install an app.

## Setup

> Note these instructions are for running the sample on your local machine, the tunnelling solution is required because
> the Teams service needs to call into the bot.

### 1. Setup for Bot
- In Azure portal, create a [Azure Bot resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-authentication?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp%2Caadv2).
- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
- While registering the bot, use `https://<your_ngrok_url>/api/messages` as the messaging endpoint.
**NOTE:** When you create app registration, you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

### 2. Setup NGROK
1) Run ngrok - point to port 3978

    ```bash
    ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
    ```
### 3. Setup for code
1) Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

2) In a terminal, navigate to `samples/app-checkin-location/nodejs`

3) Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4) Update the `.env` configuration for the bot to use the `MicrosoftAppId` and `MicrosoftAppPassword`, `BaseUrl` with application base url. For e.g., your ngrok url. (Note the MicrosoftAppId is the AppId created in step 1 (Setup for Bot), the MicrosoftAppPassword is referred to as the "client secret" in step 1 (Setup for Bot) and you can always create a new client secret anytime.)

5) Run your app

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/app-checkin-location/nodejs/index.js#L48) line and put your debugger for local debug.

### 4. Setup Manifest for Teams

- **This step is specific to Teams.**
    - Edit the `manifest.json` contained in the `appPackage/` folder to replace with your MicrosoftAppId (that was created in step1.1 and is the same value of MicrosoftAppId in `.env` file) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `{MicrosoftAppId}` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - Zip up the contents of the `appPackage/` folder to create a `manifest.zip`
    - Upload the `manifest.zip` to Teams (in the left-bottom *Apps* view, click "Upload a custom app")
