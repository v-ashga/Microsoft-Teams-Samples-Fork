# Tabs quick start

Tabs are Teams-aware webpages embedded in Microsoft Teams. A channel/group tab delivers content to channels and group chats, and are a great way to create collaborative spaces around dedicated web-based content.

## Included Features
* Tabs

## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app package (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Sideloading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

**Tab Channel quick start:** [Manifest](/samples/tab-channel-group-quickstart/js/demo-manifest/tab-channel-group-quickstart.zip)

## Prerequisites
- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
- To test locally, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed on your development machine (version 16.14.2  or higher)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) or equivalent tunneling solution
- [M365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to a Teams account with the 

## Setup

1. Register a new application in the [Azure Active Directory â€“ App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.
**NOTE:** When you create app registration, you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

2. Setup NGROK
 - Run ngrok - point to port 3978

    ```bash
    ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
    ```
3. Setup for code
- Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

- In a terminal, navigate to `samples/tab-channel-group-quickstart/ts`

- Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

- Run your app

    ```bash
    npm start

4. Setup Manifest for Teams

- **This step is specific to Teams.**
    - Edit the `manifest.json` contained in the `appPackage/` folder to replace with your MicrosoftAppId (that was created in step1.1 and is the same value of MicrosoftAppId) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `{MicrosoftAppId}` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` and replace `{{domain-name}}` with base Url of your domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app`.
    - Zip up the contents of the `appPackage/` folder to create a `manifest.zip`
    - Upload the `manifest.zip` to Teams (in the left-bottom *Apps* view, click "Upload a custom app")```
    

## Deploy to Teams
Start debugging the project by hitting the `F5` key or click the debug icon in Visual Studio Code and click the `Start Debugging` green arrow button.

### NOTE: First time debug step
On the first time running and debugging your app you need allow the localhost certificate.  After starting debugging when Chrome is launched and you have installed your app it will fail to load.

- Open a new tab `in the same browser window that was opened`
- Navigate to `https://localhost:3000/tab`
- Click the `Advanced` button
- Select the `Continue to localhost`

### NOTE: Debugging
Ensure you have the Debugger for Chrome/Edge extension installed for Visual Studio Code from the marketplace.

### Build for production
`npm run build`

## Running the sample.

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
