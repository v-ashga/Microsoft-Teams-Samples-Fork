# Outgoing Webhook Sample Node.js

## Summary

This project is an implementation of a very simple [Outgoing Webhook](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/custom-bot) for Microsoft Teams. All it does is verify that what's sending messages matches the Outgoing Webhook that was created in Teams, and it echoes back whatever is sent to it.

## Interaction with app

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or equivalent tunnelling solution
- [M365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to a Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app.

## Setup

 
1. Create Webhook
  * Create the Outgoing Webhook in Teams using the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/custom-bot). Paste the tunneling service URL from the previous step into the "Callback URL" box. After you press the Create button, copy/paste the security token that Teams generates to the clipboard.

  * Paste the security token generated by Teams as the value of `sharedSecret` in `app.js`. When you're done, it should look something like this:

    ```javascript
    const sharedSecret = "+ZaRRMC8+mpnfGaGsBOmkIFt98bttL5YQRq3p2tXgcE=";  ```

  * In the directory in which you installed this project, type `node app.js`

  * In Microsoft Teams, in any channel in the team in which you created the Outgoing Webhook, you can type `@<botname> <card-type>` then it will respond back a card with specified card type.

    Supported <card type>: "adaptive-card", "hero-card", "list-card", "o365-card", "thumbnail-card"
    
 2. Setup NGROK
- Run ngrok - point to port 3978

```bash
# ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
```
3. Setup Code

- In a terminal, navigate to `samples/outgoing-webhook/nodejs`

 - Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
 - Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
- Run your bot at the command line:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Running the sample

- Example screenshot to show Hero card:
![Hero card](Images/heroCard.png)

* Supported <card type>: "adaptive-card", "hero-card", "list-card", "o365-card", "thumbnail-card"

* If you type anything else apart from above mentioned type, it will echo back what you typed.
