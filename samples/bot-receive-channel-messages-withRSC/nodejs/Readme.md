## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app package (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Sideloading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

**Receive Channel messages with RSC permissions:** [Manifest](/samples/bot-receive-channel-messages-withRSC/csharp/demo-manifest/Bot-RSC.zip)

## Prerequisites

1. Office 365 tenant. You can get a free tenant for development use by signing up for the [Office 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program).

2. To test locally, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed on your development machine (version 16.14.2  or higher).

    ```bash
    # determine node version
    node --version
    ```

3. To test locally, you'll need [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) installed on your development machine.
Make sure you've downloaded and installed Ngrok on your local machine. ngrok will tunnel requests from the Internet to your local computer and terminate the SSL connection from Teams.

## Setup

> NOTE: The free ngrok plan will generate a new URL every time you run it, which requires you to update your Azure AD registration, the Teams app manifest, and the project configuration. A paid account with a permanent ngrok URL is recommended.

1) Setup for Bot
- Register Azure AD application
- Register a bot with Azure Bot Service, following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration?view=azure-bot-service-3.0).

- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
- While registering the bot, use `https://<your_ngrok_url>/api/messages` as the messaging endpoint.
    
    > NOTE: When you create your app registration in Azure portal, you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

2) Setup NGROK
- Run ngrok - point to port `3978`

    ```bash
    ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
    ```

3) Setup for code
- Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

- In the folder where repository is cloned navigate to `samples/bot-receive-channel-messages-withRSC/nodejs`

- Install node modules

   Inside node js folder, open your local terminal and run the below command to install node modules. You can do the same in Visual Studio code terminal by opening the project in Visual Studio code.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
- Update the `.env` configuration for the bot to use the `MicrosoftAppId` (Microsoft App Id) and `MicrosoftAppPassword` (App Password) from the AAD app registration in Azure portal or from Bot Framework registration. 
> NOTE: the App Password is referred to as the `client secret` in the azure portal app registration service and you can always create a new client secret anytime.

- Run your app
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
- Install modules & Run the NodeJS Server
  - Server will run on PORT: 3978
  - Open a terminal and navigate to project root directory
  
  ```bash
    npm run server
  ```
> NOTE:This command is equivalent to: npm install > npm start

4) Run your app

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
5) Setup Manifest for Teams

    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the `appPackage` folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your bot earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`) 
        `<<DOMAIN-NAME>>` with base Url domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app`.
         Replace <<MANIFEST-ID>> with any GUID or with your MicrosoftAppId/app id

    - **Zip** up the contents of the `appPackage` folder to create a `manifest.zip`
    - **Sideload** in a team to test
         - Select or create a team
         - Select the ellipses **...** from the left pane. The drop-down menu appears.
         - Select **Manage Team**, then select **Apps** 
         - Then select **Upload a custom app** from the lower right corner.
         - Then select the `manifest.zip` file from `appPackage`, and then select **Add** to add the bot to your selected team.

**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/bot-receive-channel-messages-withRSC/nodejs/server/api/botController.js#L24) line and put your debugger for local debug.
