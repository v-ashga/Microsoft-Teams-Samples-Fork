## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
-  [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-  [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) or equivalent tunneling solution
-  [M365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to a Teams account with the appropriate permissions to install an app.

## Setup
 1. Register a new application in the [Azure Active Directory â€“ App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.
    -  Log in to the Azure portal from your subscription, and go to the "App registrations" blade  [here](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps). Ensure that you use a tenant where admin consent for API permissions can be provided.

  - Click on "New registration", and create an Azure AD application.

  -  **Name:**  The name of your Teams app - if you are following the template for a default deployment, we recommend "App catalog lifecycle".

  -  **Supported account types:**  Select "Accounts in any organizational directory"

  -  Leave the "Redirect URL" field blank.   

  - Click on the "Register" button.

  -  When the app is registered, you'll be taken to the app's "Overview" page. Copy the  **Application (client) ID**; we will need it later. Verify that the "Supported account types" is set to  **Multiple organizations**.

  - On the side rail in the Manage section, navigate to the "Certificates & secrets" section. In the Client secrets section, click on "+ New client secret". Add a description for the secret and select Expires as "Never". Click "Add".

 - Once the client secret is created, copy its  **Value**, please take a note of the secret as it will be required later.


- At this point you have 3 unique values:
    -   Application (client) ID which will be later used during Azure bot creation
    -   Client secret for the bot which will be later used during Azure bot creation
    -   Directory (tenant) ID
We recommend that you copy these values into a text file, using an application like Notepad. We will need these values later.

-  Under left menu, navigate to  **API Permissions**, and make sure to add the following permissions of Microsoft Graph API > Application permissions:
    -  OnlineMeetings.Read.All
    -  OnlineMeetingTranscript.Read.All

Click on Add Permissions to commit your changes.

- If you are logged in as the Global Administrator, click on the Grant admin consent for %tenant-name% button to grant admin consent else, inform your admin to do the same through the portal or follow the steps provided here to create a link and send it to your admin for consent.

- Global Administrator can grant consent using following link:  [https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/adminconsent?client_id=](https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/adminconsent?client_id=)<%appId%> 

 
2. Setup for Bot
   - In Azure portal, create a [Azure Bot resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-authentication?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=csharp%2Caadv2).
   - Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
   - While registering the bot, use `https://<your_ngrok_url>/api/messages` as the messaging endpoint.
   
   - Create new Azure Bot resource in Azure.
   - Select Type of App as "Multi Tenant"
   -  Select Creation type as "Use existing app registration"
   - Use the copied App Id and Client secret from above step and fill in App Id and App secret respectively.
   - Click on Create on the Azure bot.   
   - Go to the created resource, navigate to channels and add "Microsoft Teams".
   - Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
   **NOTE:** When you create app registration, you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

3. Setup NGROK
  - Run ngrok - point to port 3978

   ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
   ```

4. Setup for code

  - Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

   - Update the `.env` configuration for the bot to use the `MicrosoftAppId` and `MicrosoftAppPassword` and `MicrosoftAppTenantId` and `AppBaseUrl` and `UserId` (Note that the MicrosoftAppId is the AppId created in step 1 , the MicrosoftAppPassword is referred to as the "client secret" in step 1 and you can always create a new client secret anytime., MicrosoftAppTenantId is reffered to as Directory tenant Id in step 1, AppBaseUrl is the URL that you get in step 3 after running ngrok, UserId of the user used while granting the policy in step 5).


  - In a terminal, navigate to `samples/meetings-transcription/nodejs`

  - Install modules

     ```bash
     npm install
     ``` 

  - Run your bot at the command line:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

5. Allow applications to access online meetings on behalf of a user
   - Follow this link- [Configure application access policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/cloud-communication-online-meeting-application-access-policy)
  - **Note**: Copy the User Id you used to granting the policy. You need while configuring the .env file.

6. Setup Manifest for Teams
- __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the ./AppPackage folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your app registration earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `{{Microsoft-App-Id}}` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` and replace `{{domain-name}}` with base Url of your domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `AppPackage` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)

- Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
   - Go to Microsoft Teams. From the lower left corner, select Apps
   - From the lower left corner, choose Upload a custom App
   - Go to your project directory, the ./AppPackage folder, select the zip folder, and choose Open.
   - Select Add in the pop-up dialog box. Your app is uploaded to Teams.

**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/meetings-transcription/nodejs/index.js#L50) line and put your debugger for local debug.
    
**NOTE: If you are not getting option to start transcript. Make sure it is enabled from [Teams Admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com). Under `Meetings -> Meeting Policies -> Applied policy(Default is Global)-> Recording & Transcription -> Transcription`**
