# Frontend client for Meeting Share to Stage Signing app

Running the `Microsoft.Teams.Samples.MeetingSigning.Web.csproj` will start a nodejs server with this code.

However, you might need to do something specific that can't be handled by the dotnet SPA server, if so here are some commands:
* To build `npm run build`
* To watch for changes `npm run start`
* To open components in Storybook `npm run storybook`
