  dotnet --version
  ```

   * Copy and paste the secret somewhere safe. You will need it in a future step.
   
2. Setup for Bot

    - Also, register a bot with Azure Bot Service, following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration?view=azure-bot-service-3.0).
  - Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
  - While registering the bot, use `https://<your_ngrok_url>/api/messages` as the messaging endpoint.

      > NOTE: When you create your app registration, you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.
      
3. Create a Azure Storage account(This is needed to store/retrieve data that's used in the app) 
     [Create storage account](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal)

      This step will create a storage account. You will require storage account name and keys in next steps.
  
      Please follow [View account keys](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-account-keys-manage?tabs=azure-portal#view-account-access-keys)  to see the keys info. 
     

4. Setup NGROK
     - Run ngrok - point to port 3978

    ```bash
     ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
    ```

5. Setup for code

  - Clone the repository

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
      ```

- Modify the `/appsettings.json` and fill in the following details:
    - `{{MicrosoftAppId}}` - Generated from Step 1 while doing AAd app registration in Azure portal.
    - `{{ MicrosoftAppPassword}}` - Generated from Step 1, also referred to as Client secret
    - `{{ StorageConnectionString }}` - Generated from Step 3,Create a Azure Storage accoun

 - Run the app from a terminal or from Visual Studio, choose option A or B.

     A) From a terminal

    ```bash
    # run the app
    dotnet run
    ```

    B) Or from Visual Studio

    - Launch Visual Studio
    - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
    - Navigate to `MeetingApp` folder
    - Select `MeetingApp.csproj` file
    - Press `F5` to run the project

6. Setup Manifest for Teams
- __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the ./AppPackage folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your app registration earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<APP-ID>>` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `<<BASE-URL>>` and replace `<<BASE-URL>>` with base Url of your domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `AppPackage` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)    
    
- Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
   - Go to Microsoft Teams. From the lower left corner, select Apps
   - From the lower left corner, choose Upload a custom App
   - Go to your project directory, the ./AppPackage folder, select the zip folder, and choose Open.
   - Select Add in the pop-up dialog box. Your app is uploaded to Teams.

**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/meeting-recruitment-app/csharp/MeetingApp/AdapterWithErrorHandler.cs#L25) line and put your debugger for local debug.
