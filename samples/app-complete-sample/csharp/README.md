![ Module ](template-bot-master-csharp/Images/Sample.gif)

## Try it yourself - experience the App in your Microsoft Teams client
Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app package (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Sideloading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

**Microsoft Teams Bot:** [Manifest](/samples/app-complete-sample/csharp/demo-manifest/Complete-Sample.zip)

## Prerequisites

* Install Git for windows: https://git-for-windows.github.io/

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) version 6.0

  determine dotnet version
  ```bash
  dotnet --version
  ```
- [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) (For local environment testing) Latest (any other tunneling software can also be used)
  
- [Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com) Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account
    
## Setup

NOTE: Teams does not work nor render things exactly like the Bot Emulator, but it is a quick way to see if your bot is running and functioning correctly.

1. Register a new application in the [Azure Active Directory â€“ App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.

2. Setup for Bot
	- Register a AAD aap registration in Azure portal.
	- Also, register a bot with Azure Bot Service, following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration?view=azure-bot-service-3.0).
	- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
	- While registering the bot, use `https://<your_ngrok_url>/api/messages` as the messaging endpoint.

    > NOTE: When you create your app registration, you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

3. Setup NGROK
      - Run ngrok - point to port 3978

	```bash
	 ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
	```   
4. Setup for code

  - Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```
5. Modify the `/appsettings.json` and fill in the following details:
  - `{{BotId}}` - Generated from Step 1 is the application app id
  - `{{MicrosoftAppId}}` - Generated from Step 1 is the application app id
  - `{{MicrosoftAppPassword}}` - Generated from Step 1, also referred to as Client secret
  - `{{BaseUri}}` - Your application's base url. E.g. https://12345.ngrok-free.app if you are using ngrok.

	Here is an example for reference:
		<add key="BotId" value="Bot_Handle_Here" />
		<add key="MicrosoftAppId" value="88888888-8888-8888-8888-888888888888" />
		<add key="MicrosoftAppPassword" value="aaaa22229999dddd0000999" />
		<add key="BaseUri" value="https://#####abc.ngrok-free.app" />
		<add key="FBConnectionName" value="connectionname" />
		<add key="FBProfileUrl" value="profileurl" />
		
6. To test facebook auth flow [create a facebookapp](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-service-channel-connect-facebook?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) and get client id and secret for facebook app.
    Now go to your bot channel registartion -> configuration -> Add OAuth connection string
   - Provide connection Name : for eg `FBConnectionName`
   - Provide FBProfileUrl: for eg `FBProfileUrl`
   
6. Run the bot from a terminal or from Visual Studio:

    A) From a terminal, navigate to `samples/app-checkin-location/csharp`

	  ```bash
	  # run the bot
	  dotnet run
	  ```
	  Or from Visual Studio
	     - Launch Visual Studio
	     - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
	     - Navigate to `app-complete-sample` folder
	     - Select `template-bot-master-csharp.sln` file
	     - Press `F5` to run the project

7. Setup Manifest for Teams
	- __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
	    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the ./manifest or ./manifest_hub folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your app registration earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `{{Microsoft-App-Id}}` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
	    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` and replace `{{domain-name}}` with base Url of your domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app`.
	    - **Zip** up the contents of the `manifest` or 'manifest_hub.json' folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)

	- Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
	   - Go to Microsoft Teams. From the lower left corner, select Apps
	   - From the lower left corner, choose Upload a custom App
	   - Go to your project directory, the ./manifest folder, select the zip folder, and choose Open.
	   - Select Add in the pop-up dialog box. Your app is uploaded to Teams.
   		
**Note:** If you want to test your app across multi hub like: Outlook/Office.com, please update the `manifest.json` in the `/manifest_hub` folder with the required values.


**Note**: If you are facing any issue in your app, please uncomment [this](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/blob/main/samples/app-complete-sample/csharp/AdapterWithErrorHandler.cs#L23) line and put your debugger for local debug.
   
Congratulations!!! You have just created and sideloaded your first Microsoft Teams app! Try adding a configurable tab, at-mentioning your bot by its registered name, or viewing your static tabs.<br><br>
NOTE: Most of this sample app's functionality will now work. The only limitations are the authentication examples because your app is not registered with AAD nor Visual Studio Team Services.

## Overview

This project is meant to help a Teams developer in two ways.  First, it is meant to show many examples of how an app can integrate into Teams.  Second, it is meant to give a set of patterns, templates, and tools that can be used as a starting point for creating a larger, scalable, more enterprise level bot to work within Teams.  Although this project focuses on creating a robust bot, it does include simples examples of tabs as well as examples of how a bot can give links into these tabs.

## What it is

At a high level, this project is written in C#, built to run a .Net, and uses the BotFramework to handle the bot's requests and responses. This project is designed to be run in Visual Studio using its debugger in order to leverage breakpoints. Most directories will hold a README file which will describe what the files within that directory do.
The easiest way to get started is to follow the steps listed in the "Steps to get started running the Bot Emulator". Once this is complete and running, the easiest way to add your own content is to create a new dialog in src/dialogs by copying one from src/dialogs/examples, change it accordingly, and then instantiate it with the others in the RootDialog.cs.

## General Architecture

Most code files that need to be compile reside in the src directory. Most files outside of the src directory are static files used for either configuration or for providing static resources to tabs, e.g. images and html.

## Files and Directories

* **manifest**<br><br>
This directory holds the skeleton of a manifest.json file that can be altered in order sideload this application into a team.

* **middleware**<br><br>
This directory holds the stripping at mention for channel class and Invoke message processing.

* **Views**<br><br>
The main content of the static comes from the static files placed in /Views/BotInfo/BotInfo.cshtml.

* **src**<br><br>
This directory holds all the code files, which run the entire application.

* **utility**<br><br>
This directory holds utility functions for the project.

## Steps included in migration of Bot framework from v3 to V4
