Please find below demo manifest which is deployed on Microsoft Azure and you can try it yourself by uploading the app package (.zip file link below) to your teams and/or as a personal app. (Sideloading must be enabled for your tenant, [see steps here](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant#enable-custom-teams-apps-and-turn-on-custom-app-uploading)).

   ```
    
## Setup


1. Register a new application in the [Azure Active Directory â€“ App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.

    > NOTE: When you create your app registration, you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

2. Setup NGROK
   - Run ngrok - point to port 3978

  ```bash
   ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
  ```

3. Setup for code

- Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```
    
     In a terminal, navigate to `samples/meeting-live-coding-interview/csharp`

    ```bash
    # change into project folder
    cd # MeetingLiveCoding
    
    Run the app from a terminal or from Visual Studio, choose option A or B.

  A) From a terminal

  ```bash
  # run the app
  dotnet run
  ```

  B) Or from Visual Studio

  - Launch Visual Studio
  - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
  - Navigate to `MeetingLiveCoding` folder
  - Select `MeetingLiveCoding.csproj` file
  - Press `F5` to run the project

- Inside ClientApp folder execute the below command.

    ```bash
    # npx @fluidframework/azure-local-service@latest
    ```
4. Setup Manifest for Teams
 - __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the ./AppPackage folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your app registration earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `{{Microsoft-App-Id}}` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` and replace `{{domain-name}}` with base Url of your domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `AppPackage` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)

- Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
   - Go to Microsoft Teams. From the lower left corner, select Apps
   - From the lower left corner, choose Upload a custom App
   - Go to your project directory, the ./AppPackage folder, select the zip folder, and choose Open.
   - Select Add in the pop-up dialog box. Your app is uploaded to Teams.


**Note** Run the app on desktop client with developer preview on.
