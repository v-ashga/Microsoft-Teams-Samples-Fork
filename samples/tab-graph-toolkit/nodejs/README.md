## Prerequisites
- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
- To test locally, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed on your development machine (version 16.14.2  or higher)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) or equivalent tunneling solution
- [M365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to a Teams account with the 

## Setup

1. Register a new application in the [Azure Active Directory â€“ App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.
   - Register an App in Azure. Navigate to App registeration click on New registeration.
   - Update your App Name `mgtteamstab`
   - Click on Add a Platform in redirect URI section.
   - Select Single Page Application and add following URL  `<<base-url>>/tabauth`
   - Save and register.
   - Once App is registerd copy the `client_Id` for your app and update in the app.

3. Setup NGROK
 - Run ngrok - point to port 3978

    ```bash
    ngrok http 3978 --host-header="localhost:3978"
    ```
4. Setup for code

  - Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```
  - Build and Run

  In the project directory, execute:

     ``` bash
     npm install
     ```

     ``` bash
     npm start
     ```

5. Setup Manifest for Teams
- __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the ./AppPackage folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your app registration earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `{{Microsoft-App-Id}}` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` and replace `{{domain-name}}` with base Url of your domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok-free.app` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok-free.app`.
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `AppPackage` folder to create a `manifest.zip` (Make sure that zip file does not contains any subfolder otherwise you will get error while uploading your .zip package)

- Upload the manifest.zip to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")
   - Go to Microsoft Teams. From the lower left corner, select Apps
   - From the lower left corner, choose Upload a custom App
   - Go to your project directory, the ./AppPackage folder, select the zip folder, and choose Open.
   - Select Add in the pop-up dialog box. Your app is uploaded to Teams.
## User Interaction
- Once you access the Tab within your app you will be able to see following microsoft-graph-toolkit component. 
-<mgt-login>, <mgt-agenda>, <mgt-people-picker>, <mgt-tasks>

## Deploy to Teams
Start debugging the project by hitting the `F5` key or click the debug icon in Visual Studio Code and click the `Start Debugging` green arrow button.

### NOTE: First time debug step
On the first time running and debugging your app you need allow the localhost certificate.  After starting debugging when Chrome is launched and you have installed your app it will fail to load.

- Open a new tab `in the same browser window that was opened`
- Navigate to `https://localhost:3000/`
- Click the `Advanced` button
- Select the `Continue to localhost`

### NOTE: Debugging
Ensure you have the Debugger for Chrome/Edge extension installed for Visual Studio Code from the marketplace.

### Build for production
`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
